IRCopTools 7.0
--------------
This is a Windows script. It runs on Windows.
This is a script for mIRC. You need to download mIRC from https://www.mirc.co.uk/

Best is to install the script from the EXE Installer

Manual Installation
-------------------
Uncompress inside mIRC's Application Data directory: %appdata%\mirc
If you open %appdata%\mIRC it will usually open C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\mIRC
where you need to download the script source.
That will create a subdirectory named ircoptools (ie: c:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\mIRC\ircoptools\)

That's it! Now in mIRC once connected you have to load the tools with the following command:
    /load -rs ircoptools\ircoptools.mrc

Feel free to add this line to your perform list too.

If you want to configure your IRCopTools, press F3 or type:
   /configure
